NAME
  uchess - terminal user interface for UCI chess engines.
SYNOPSIS
  uchess [-black player] [-white player] [-cfg config] [-themes] [-tmpl]
DESCRIPTION
  uchess is an interactive terminal chess client designed to allow
  gameplay and move analysis in conjunction with UCI chess engines.

  uchess is highly configurable, fully themeable, and capable of
  supporting a variety of play scenarios including human vs. human,
  human vs. cpu, and cpu vs. cpu.

  Games may be initialized via FEN notation and exported to PGN notation
  for further analysis in third-party engines. Additionally, board
  snapshots may be saved to SVG image format for the purpose of sharing
  or archiving board state.

  A hint engine is provided to assist players in discovering the best
  move in a given scenario and game state may be walked backward on an
  as-needed basis to facilitate game tree exploration.

  Game moves are input as algebraic notation via an interactive command
  shell, and a variety of auxillary commands are supported.
EXAMPLE
    With no arguments specified, uchess will attempt to locate stockfish
    in your path and run it with difficulty level 3.

    If stockfish cannot be found, uchess provides for an automated installation
    on Linux and Windows. Automated install for Mac is a work in progress.

    If manual configuration is required, please do the following:

    Generate a uchess config and edit it accordingly.

    Mac and Linux

      $ uchess -tmpl > uchess.json

    Windows

      # Avoid BOM in config file
      > .\uchess.exe -tmpl | set-content uchess.json -Encoding Ascii


    Run uchess on the config.

      $ uchess -cfg uchess.json
OPTIONS
  -help          Display command usage.
  -black         Black piece input <cpu|human>.
  -white         White piece input <cpu|human>.
  -cfg           Path to config file.
  -tmpl          Write default config to stdout and exit.
  -themes        Write theme names to stdout and exit.
SHELL COMMANDS
  uchess accepts commands via an interactive shell. The following commands
  are supported.

  back           Walk the game state back one turn.
  save           Save the PGN for the current game in the CWD.
  image          Save an SVG snapshot of the current game in the CWD.
  fen            Display the FEN string for the current game.
  reset          Reset the board to the default FEN.
  resign         The current player resigns.
  hint           Highlight the recommended move using the hint engine.
  quit           Shutdown uchess immediately without saving game state.

  If none of the previous commands are recognized, the input is assumed
  to be a move specified in algebraic notation.

  Examples:
      e4         Pawn to e4.
      exd5       Pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d5.
      O-O        King castles on kingside.
      O-O-O      King castles on queenside.
      e8=Q       Pawn promotion to queen.
BASE CONFIG FORMAT
  When invoked with the -tmpl argument, uchess will generate a config with
  a reasonable set of defaults. The config file is a JSON document with
  the following top-level keys.

  uciWhite       Name of the UCI engine controlling white pieces.
  uciBlack       Name of the UCI engine controlling black pieces.
  uciHint        Name of the UCI engine providing hints.
  uciEngines     A list of available UCI engines (see UCI CONFIG FORMAT).
  fen            FEN notation specifying starting positions.
  activeTheme    The currently selected theme (list available via -themes).
  theme          A list of available themes (see THEMES).
  whitePiece     Player controlling the white pieces (cpu or human).
  blackPiece     Player controlling the black pieces (cpu or human).
  whiteName      Player name for white pieces in UI.
  blackName      Player name for black pieces in UI.
UCI CONFIG FORMAT
  The uchess config file may reference any number of UCI engines; however,
  each engine must by identified by a unique name parameter. The following
  keys are supported for UCI configuration.

  name           The unique UCI engine name.
  engine         The path to the UCI engine binary (OS dependent).
  hash           The value in MB for hash table memory.
  ponder         Allow or disallow the engine to ponder.
  ownBook        Specifies whether the engine has its own opening book.
  multiPV        The engine supports multi best line or k-best mode.
  depth          Search x plies only. A setting of 0 specifies unlimited plies.
  searchMoves    Restrict search to moves specified (i.e., "e2e4 d2d4").
  moveTime       Search exactly x mseconds.
  options        Key-value pairs for arbitrary engine commands.
THEMES
  uchess is fully themeable, and user specified themes may be added to the
  uchess config file. The theme keys are named in a manner which is intended to
  be self-explanatory, and colors are specified by their respective hex
  values. It is recommended to limit colors to the spectrum supported by
  your terminal. xterm-256 (8-bit color) is the official standard for
  builtin themes.

  The builtin themes are packaged into the uchess binary using pkger, and
  it is necessary to invoke this command before compilation when a theme
  is added to the themes project directory.

  Pull requests for new builtin themes are welcome; however, the specified
  colors must fall under the xterm-256 standard. A color chart is available here:

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm#/media/File:Xterm_256color_chart.svg

  Builtin themes should be specified on a one theme per file basis, and all
  themes should be specified in JSON format and reside in the themes directory.

  When a name collision occurs, themes specified in the config file will
  override builtin themes.

  Lastly, a special hex code of #0 is used to specify the terminal default
  color. This code should be used for any UI elements that may collide with
  an underlying color scheme (i.e., avoiding white fonts on white backgrounds).
GAME OUTCOMES
  uchess can effectively identify a wide variety of game outcomes, and it should
  account for the following end-game scenarios:

    Checkmate
    Stalemate
    Resignation (manual)
    Threefold Repetition
    Fivefold Repetition
    Fifty Move Rule
    Seventy Five Move Rule
    Insufficient Material
CPU MATCHES
  If the uchess config specifies both whitePiece and blackPiece as cpu,
  the specified UCI engines will play against each other. The game will
  cycle forward one move each time tne enter key is pressed.
PLATFORM SUPPORT
  uchess has been tested and confirmed to work on Linux, MacOS, and Windows
  (Windows Terminal) platforms. It should work with a wide variety of terminals.
